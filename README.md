# My-Journey-to-Becoming-a-Data-Scientist

The path to becoming a Data Scientist is both challenging and rewarding, requiring a blend of technical expertise, analytical thinking, and continuous learning. Here’s a glimpse into my journey so far:

Building the Foundations

I started with SQL, Python, and Tableau, mastering the fundamentals through hands-on projects and structured coursework. Each tool brought a new dimension to data analysis:

 SQL – Learning to extract, manipulate, and analyze structured data efficiently.
 Python (Pandas) – Cleaning and transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
 Tableau – Gaining expertise in data visualization and storytelling through dashboards.

Expanding My Skillset

Beyond the fundamentals, I deepened my understanding of data analysis, statistical methods, and business decision-making through:

 Data Cleaning & Storytelling – Using Pandas to preprocess, structure, and present data effectively.
 A/B Testing – Conducting hypothesis testing to drive data-driven decisions.
 SQL Window Functions – Performing advanced calculations across table partitions.
 Stored Routines in SQL – Automating complex database operations for efficiency.

Applying Knowledge to Real-World Projects

With a solid foundation, I worked on data-driven projects, analyzing datasets, deriving insights, and presenting findings in a structured way. Key achievements include:

 Advanced Data Analysis – Executing SQL queries and Python scripts to extract meaningful patterns.
 Data Visualization – Creating impactful dashboards in Tableau to communicate insights effectively.

Looking Ahead

The journey to becoming a Data Scientist is a continuous process of learning, experimenting, and growing. With each project and challenge, I refine my skills and gain new perspectives, bringing me one step closer to my goal.

Excited for what’s next on this journey!
